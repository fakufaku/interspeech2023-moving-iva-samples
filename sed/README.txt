Each example has
(1) a mixture ("mix.wav"),
(2) four separated signals of TIV-IVA and ATT-IVA,
(3) figure.png, and
(4) info.txt.

The wav file name of separated signals were formatted as "[method]_[track_ID].wav".
"tiv" in [method] indicates TIV-IVA, and "att" indicates ATT-IVA.
[track_ID] indicates the ID of four separated signals with the range of 0 through 3.

figure.png shows the SED results of the MIX, TIV, and ATT for an event.
The figure also shows the spectrogram of the corresponding mixture/separated signal.
The spectrograms of the separated signal were subjectively selected from the four signals.

summary.pptx has attached a figure and the corresponding wav file for each example.
